    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use specific exception types: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic exception handler. This makes your code more robust and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep try/except blocks small: Wrap only the code that can raise an exception in the try block. This will make it easier to identify which code is causing the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use finally blocks: Use finally blocks to ensure that critical resources, such as file handles or database connections, are always released.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Log exceptions: Always log exceptions, including the stack trace, to aid in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Don't catch exceptions you can't handle: Avoid catching exceptions that you cannot handle properly. This can mask errors and make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Raise exceptions when appropriate: Raise exceptions when something goes wrong rather than returning error codes or None. This makes it easier to identify and handle errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Be consistent with your exception handling style: Adopt a consistent style for your exception handling throughout your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Keep error messages clear and concise: Error messages should be clear and concise, and provide enough information to aid in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Use exception chaining: When handling exceptions, include the original exception using exception chaining. This provides more information about the root cause of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Test your exception handling: Ensure that your exception handling code is tested thoroughly, including testing the handling of unexpected exceptions."
