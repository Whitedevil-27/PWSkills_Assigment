    "A database is a collection of related data that is stored and organized in a way that enables easy access, retrieval, and management. A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to define, create, and manage databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two main types of database management systems. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined columns and data types. They use SQL as the primary language for querying and manipulating data, and are designed to handle structured data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible, unstructured way. They do not use SQL as the primary language, but instead use other query languages or APIs. NoSQL databases are designed to handle semi-structured or unstructured data, such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Structure: SQL databases use a tabular structure with predefined columns and data types, while NoSQL databases use a flexible schema that can handle unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as the primary language for querying and manipulating data, while NoSQL databases use other query languages or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more nodes to a cluster. SQL databases can also be scaled horizontally, but it requires more effort and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce strong data integrity and consistency through the use of constraints, transactions, and foreign key relationships. NoSQL databases offer weaker data integrity and consistency guarantees, but they offer higher availability and partition tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are best suited for handling structured data with well-defined relationships between tables, while NoSQL databases are better suited for handling semi-structured or unstructured data that requires flexibility and scalability."

It is used to establish relationships between tables, and to enforce referential integrity. A Foreign Key column in one table must match a Primary Key column in another table. This ensures that the data in the Foreign Key column(s) is consistent with the data in the Primary Key column(s).\n",
