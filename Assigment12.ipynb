    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the program terminates and displays an error message that provides information about the cause of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as trying to access a file that does not exist, dividing a number by zero, or calling a method that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are errors that occur during the parsing of a program, while exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are usually caused by incorrect syntax, such as misspelled keywords, missing or extra parentheses, or incorrect indentation. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, as the Python interpreter is unable to parse the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of a program and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as invalid input, unexpected conditions, or resource limitations. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program using exception handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are errors that occur during the parsing of a program due to incorrect syntax. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program, while syntax errors must be fixed before the program can run."

The square_root() function takes a number as input and raises a NegativeNumberError if the number is negative. If the number is non-negative, the function calculates and returns its square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main part of the code, we attempt to calculate the square root of the negative number -4 using the square_root() function. Since this number is negative, an exception is raised and caught by the except block. The error message provided by the custom exception class is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a custom exception in this example, we can explicitly handle the case where a negative number is provided as input to the square_root() function, and provide a meaningful error message to the user. This can help improve the usability and maintainability of the code."
